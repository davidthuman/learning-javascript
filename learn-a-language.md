## Reading Documentation

Reading some formal or review documentation of the language before you jump into actual coding is sometimes necessary
If you are coming from an OOP-language and are attempting to learn a functional one, some overview of the syntax and patterns available are important. Even just planning the idea in your head so you can look it up later is important to start the journey.

You should learn:
* Static or Dynamic Types
* Compiled or Interpreted
* Object-Oriented or Functional
* How does memory management work? (need to allocated, garbage-collector, borrow-checker)
* Use-cases for the language

Maybe start with the language's wiki page for a quick understanding
Find a large guide online and read through its table-of-contents
Find a smaller guide and read through it

## Exploriation and Documentation

Start solving Advent of Code problems in the language you are trying to learn.
Or LeetCode

* reading from a file
* string processing
* overview of tools that are available when solving different problems
* learn typing system
* control flow (if-statements or pattern matching)
* iterators (while- and for-loops)

Also helps to learn how to look up documentation on the language so you can solve a problem
Learn by doing

With regards to Advent of Code, there is a large community who are all invested in creating solutions to these problems. You can talk to others if you need help, code-review others solutions, and read others technical write-ups about their solutions.

After this is done, you can go back to an online resource and read-up on some aspects of the language that you didn't fully understand.

## Data Structures and Algorithms

By now, you show be somewhat familar with the syntax of the language and possess a general overview of the tools available.

It is now time to implement popular data structures and algorithms in the language.

* Stronger understanding of classes, objects, or structs within the language
* Proper control flow and data handling
* Memory management
* 

## Mini Projects 

Websockets Server
Chatroom client
* Join Room
* Leave Room
* Message in Room

Explore the language's standard library, or use of third-party libraries to create a project
* Language ecosystem
* How modules work
* How does it handle 'async'

## Large Project

Learn to maintainence process of a large code base in the language
Memory management

This larger scale gives you the language in its entirety
